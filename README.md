# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras
The following implementation of the model is mostly taken from the tutorial available [here]( https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-from-scratch-for-mnist-handwritten-digit-classification/). 
</br>

The [Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) __(MNIST)__ handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning. The dataset can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use Convolutional Neural Networks __(CNN)__ for image classification.

__Objective__: classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9 inclusively.
